## Complete linear algebra: theory and implementation in code

![Linear Algebra](linearAlgebra.PNG)

Learn concepts in linear algebra and matrix analysis, and implement them in MATLAB and Python. Personally I use this to have more hands-on experience with some abstract concepts at school

Boosting my knowledge to up to speed. This contains exercise files and my own notes alongside with them.<br/>

- todo Matrix rank ja esimerkki
- todo more when time

- Todo katso noi tehtÃ¤vÃ¤t pythonilla ja mathlabilla
- todo lissÃ¤Ã¤ quizzes??? pohdi
- todo toi .csCode tarpeellinen?
- todo check if notes to cloud would be better? From some student
