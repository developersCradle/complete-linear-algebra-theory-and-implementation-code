- We can write **W2** as scaled version of **W1**

- Second example **V2** can be expresed as linear combination of **V1** and **V2**

- Now we can say that these two sets **{W1,W2} and {V1,V2,V3}** are linearly dependent sets
    - Linear dependent is property for **set of vectors**, not property of vector in a set!

- **W1** and **W2** cannot be expressed as itself with scalar, there fore they are **Linearly independet set**
- **?** not alway easy see is the set of vectors **linearly independet**
    - There is techniques to figure this one out

- 1. if 0, this is linearly indendent set

- 1. Example, we can express othere vector with multiple of other vector > **Dependet set**
- 2. Example, no scalar can change others vectors direction > **Independent set**
    - Expect, if both **0 vectors**, this is trivial so we ignore this
- 3. **Dependet set**, we are in **R^2** and we just need figure out compination of blue and yellow to express the white vector
    - Just need two vectors to reach anypoint in **R^2**

- If vector point direction where combination of two cannot reach, **Independet set**

- **REMEMEBER** independet/dependence describes **set of vectors** not independet vector in that set

- Just remember this theorem
    - 1. If more vectors than dimensions, necessarily **dependent set**
    - 2. Could be independet set, see picture 3rd picture from beginning with two vectors for reference

- 1. 4 vectors in r^3 space, set must be **dependent**

- 2. If zeros there is **zero-vector**, any time zero will be zero vector. **Linearly dependent**
